# ALY6015 Module 1 Assignment: Regression Diagnostics with R

## Introduction

In this folder, I present my work for the Module 1 assignment of the ALY6015 course. The assignment was an engaging challenge that involved applying regression diagnostics to understand and improve upon regression models using the R programming language.

## Assignment Overview

The task was to take the AmesHousing dataset and perform a series of steps to fit two regression models. The process began with exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the dataset's structure and main characteristics. I then prepared the data for modeling, handling missing values, and ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis.

A significant part of the assignment was to produce and interpret a correlation matrix, which helped me select the most relevant variables for the regression model. I then fitted the regression models, carefully interpreting each coefficient and considering the implications for real-world housing data.

## My Work

Throughout this assignment, I:

- Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Prepared the data for regression analysis, imputing missing values and ensuring data integrity.
- Generated a correlation matrix and selected variables based on their relationship with the target variable.
- Fitted regression models and interpreted the results, providing context and meaning to the coefficients.
- Diagnosed the models for multicollinearity and outliers, using diagnostic plots and statistical tests to identify issues.
- Improved the models based on the diagnostics, refining my approach to enhance model performance.
- Employed the all subsets regression method to determine the "best" model and compared it to my initial models.

## Reflection

Reflecting on this assignment, I appreciate the complexity of building a robust regression model and the importance of diagnostics in the modeling process. It was a practical exercise in applying statistical theory to real data, and it reinforced my understanding of the nuances involved in model selection and evaluation.

I am pleased to share this work with those interested in regression analysis and diagnostics. It represents not only the technical skills I've developed but also my analytical thought process and commitment to improving model accuracy.

Your interest in my work is greatly appreciated, and I hope it provides you with insights into the practical application of regression diagnostics and model evaluation.
