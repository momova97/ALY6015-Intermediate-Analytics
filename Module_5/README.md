# Module 5 Assignment: Non-parametric Methods and Sampling

## Introduction

Welcome to my exploration of nonparametric statistical methods and sampling in Module 5! In this assignment, I've embraced the challenge of applying various hypothesis tests and delved into the realm of nonparametric statistics. My journey involved sign tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, signed-rank tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and runs tests, along with computing the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. I've also demonstrated my understanding of different sampling methods and identified potential biases in survey questions.

## Summary

Throughout this assignment, I've completed a series of problems using R and MS Excel, ensuring to:

1. State the hypotheses and identify the claims.
2. Find the critical values for hypothesis testing.
3. Compute the test values with accuracy.
4. Make informed decisions based on statistical evidence.
5. Summarize the results in a clear and concise manner.

From analyzing game attendance to scrutinizing lottery ticket sales, I've applied nonparametric hypothesis testing to draw meaningful conclusions. I've also investigated the lengths of prison sentences and the number of wins in baseball games, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test to uncover insights.

## Outcomes

My findings from this assignment are as follows:

- The median attendance at local football games was not significantly different from 3,000, as determined by the sign test.
- There was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the median number of lottery tickets sold per day was below 200.
- No significant difference in prison sentence lengths between genders was found.
- The number of wins in baseball games did not show a significant difference between the leagues.

Each problem provided a unique scenario to apply nonparametric methods, enhancing my statistical analysis skills.

## Reflection

This assignment has been an enriching experience, highlighting the advantages and versatility of nonparametric methods when traditional assumptions do not hold. Through sports statistics, lottery odds, and more, I've gained valuable insights into the application of these techniques in various contexts. I'm excited to share my findings with those interested in my work and look forward to applying these methods in future data-driven projects.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work on this assignment. It has been a statistically enlightening journey!
