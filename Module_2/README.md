# Module 2 Assignment: Chi-Square Testing and ANOVA

## Assignment Reflection

In this module, I delved into the world of Chi-Square Testing and ANOVA, applying these statistical methods to various datasets, including `baseball.csv` and `crop_data.csv`. The assignment required me to test distributions for goodness of fit, examine variables for independence, and explore the homogeneity of proportions using Chi-Square tests. Additionally, I employed one-way and two-way ANOVA techniques to investigate significant differences among means and interactions between factors.

## Assignment Summary

The tasks in this assignment were multifaceted and included:

- Testing the blood type distribution of hospital patients against the general population.
- Analyzing on-time performance data for an airline and comparing it to government statistics.
- Investigating whether movie admissions are related to ethnicity and if there's a relationship between rank and branch in the military.
- Examining the sodium content in various foods to determine if there are significant differences in mean sodium amounts.
- Analyzing sales data for leading companies and per-pupil expenditures across different regions to identify differences in means.
- Exploring the impact of grow-lights and plant food on plant growth, looking for interactions and differences in mean growth.

## Reflection on the Assignment

This assignment was a rigorous exercise in statistical analysis, requiring careful hypothesis formulation, critical value calculation, test value computation, decision-making, and result summarization. I learned to appreciate the nuances of statistical testing and the importance of interpreting results within the context of the data.

The Chi-Square tests provided insights into the distribution and independence of variables, while ANOVA allowed me to compare means across different groups. The practical application of these tests on real datasets reinforced my understanding of when and how to use them effectively.

## Assignment Outcomes

Through this assignment, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

- The Chi-Square test for goodness of fit and its application in determining if sample data comes from a specific distribution.
- The Chi-Square test of independence, which helped me explore relationships between categorical variables.
- The one-way ANOVA test, which was instrumental in comparing means across multiple groups and identifying significant differences.
- The two-way ANOVA test, which allowed me to examine the main effects and interactions between two factors.

I am pleased to share the outcomes of this assignment, which not only demonstrate my technical skills in R but also my analytical abilities in interpreting complex datasets and drawing meaningful conclusions.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work on this assignment.
