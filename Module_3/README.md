# Module 3 Assignment: GLM and Logistic Regression

## Introduction

In Module 3, we explored the application of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Logistic Regression within the R programming environment. The assignment's primary objective was to construct a logistic regression model using the College dataset from the ISLR library. This model aimed to predict the classification of universities as either private or public.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment involved several critical steps to build and evaluate the logistic regression model:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis on the College dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Dividing the dataset into training and test sets to ensure the model's robustness against unseen data.
- Utilizing the `glm()` function to fit a logistic regression model with selected predictors.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the training set using a confusion matrix and calculating metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Specificity.
- Repeating the performance evaluation on the test set and plotting the ROC curve to assess the model's discriminative capacity.
- Computing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to quantify the model's overall performance.

## Assignment Outcomes

The logistic regression model exhibited strong predictive capabilities, as evidenced by high sensitivity and specificity values. The ROC curve analysis and AUC further confirmed the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between private and public universities. The assignment highlighted the importance of a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess a model's predictive performance.

## Reflection on the Assignment

Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with logistic regression, a fundamental technique for binary classification problems. The process of selecting an appropriate model based on predictor significance and AIC was particularly enlightening. The assignment emphasized the need to consider the balance between model accuracy and its ability to generalize to new data.

The skills acquired in this module, including data handling, model fitting, and interpretation of results in R, are invaluable for my future work in analytics. I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on this assignment and share the insights gained.

Thank you for reviewing my work on this assignment.
